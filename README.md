# Responsive Design Project
I decided to try the **FreeCodeCamp** responsive design. I have no professional or academic training in HTML, CSS or Javascript. 

This is the result of a very basic webpage trying to use responsive-design (looks fairly decent from a small mobile phone to a full-hd monitor) using skills that I have gained exclusively through books that I read in the library when I had spare time at university. This is my first attempt using a *mobile-first* approach.
